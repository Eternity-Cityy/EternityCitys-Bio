Hello,

This project was created with the aim of encouraging individuals to think twice before clicking on random links found in others' bios, particularly on platforms like Discord. 
Two versions are available: one displays a fake IP address to caution the user, while the other does not. 
You are welcome to use either version, and it is not limited to Discord usage.

Personally, I prefer to err on the side of caution, but the choice is yours.
