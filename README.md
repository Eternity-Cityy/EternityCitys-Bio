Hello,

This project was created with the intent of encouraging individuals to think twice before clicking on random links found in others' bios. 
There are two versions available: one displays a fake IP address to caution the user, while the other does not. 
You are welcome to use either version.

Personally, I prefer to err on the side of caution, but the choice is yours.
